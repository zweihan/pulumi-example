 * The AssuredWorkloads Workload resource
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic_workload
 * A basic test of a assuredworkloads api
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const primary = new gcp.assuredworkloads.Workload("primary", {
 *     billingAccount: "billingAccounts/000000-0000000-0000000-000000",
 *     complianceRegime: "FEDRAMP_MODERATE",
 *     displayName: "Workload Example",
 *     kmsSettings: {
 *         nextRotationTime: "9999-10-02T15:01:23Z",
 *         rotationPeriod: "10368000s",
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         "label-one": "value-one",
 *     },
 *     location: "us-west1",
 *     organization: "123456789",
 *     provisionedResourcesParent: "folders/519620126891",
 *     resourceSettings: [
 *         {
 *             resourceType: "CONSUMER_PROJECT",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             resourceType: "ENCRYPTION_KEYS_PROJECT",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             resourceId: "ring",
 *             resourceType: "KEYRING",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Workload can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:assuredworkloads/workload:Workload default organizations/{{organization}}/locations/{{location}}/workloads/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:assuredworkloads/workload:Workload default {{organization}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
