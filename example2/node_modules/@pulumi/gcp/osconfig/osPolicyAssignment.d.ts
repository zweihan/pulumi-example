/**
 * Represents an OSPolicyAssignment resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Fixed_os_policy_assignment
 * An example of an osconfig os policy assignment with fixed rollout disruption budget
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const primary = new gcp.osconfig.OsPolicyAssignment("primary", {
 *     description: "A test os policy assignment",
 *     instanceFilter: {
 *         all: false,
 *         exclusionLabels: [{
 *             labels: {
 *                 "label-two": "value-two",
 *             },
 *         }],
 *         inclusionLabels: [{
 *             labels: {
 *                 "label-one": "value-one",
 *             },
 *         }],
 *         inventories: [{
 *             osShortName: "centos",
 *             osVersion: "8.*",
 *         }],
 *     },
 *     location: "us-west1-a",
 *     osPolicies: [{
 *         allowNoResourceGroupMatch: false,
 *         description: "A test os policy",
 *         id: "policy",
 *         mode: "VALIDATION",
 *         resourceGroups: [{
 *             inventoryFilters: [{
 *                 osShortName: "centos",
 *                 osVersion: "8.*",
 *             }],
 *             resources: [{
 *                 id: "apt",
 *                 pkg: {
 *                     apt: {
 *                         name: "bazel",
 *                     },
 *                     desiredState: "INSTALLED",
 *                 },
 *             }],
 *         }],
 *     }],
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     rollout: {
 *         disruptionBudget: {
 *             fixed: 1,
 *         },
 *         minWaitDuration: "3.5s",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * OSPolicyAssignment can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/osPolicyAssignment:OsPolicyAssignment default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/osPolicyAssignments/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/osPolicyAssignment:OsPolicyAssignment default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:osconfig/osPolicyAssignment:OsPolicyAssignment default {{location}}/{{name}}
