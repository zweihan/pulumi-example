/**
 * Capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for BigQuery jobs (in the form of slots) with some committed period of usage. Annual commitments renew by default. Commitments can be removed after their commitment end time passes.
 *
 * In order to remove annual commitment, its plan needs to be changed to monthly or flex first.
 *
 * To get more information about CapacityCommitment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rest/v1/projects.locations.capacityCommitments)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Introduction to Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Bigquery Reservation Capacity Commitment Docs
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.bigquery.CapacityCommitment("example", {
 *     capacityCommitmentId: "example-commitment",
 *     edition: "ENTERPRISE",
 *     location: "us-west2",
 *     plan: "FLEX_FLAT_RATE",
 *     slotCount: 100,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * CapacityCommitment can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/capacityCommitment:CapacityCommitment default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/capacityCommitments/{{capacity_commitment_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/capacityCommitment:CapacityCommitment default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{capacity_commitment_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/capacityCommitment:CapacityCommitment default {{location}}/{{capacity_commitment_id}}
 * ```
