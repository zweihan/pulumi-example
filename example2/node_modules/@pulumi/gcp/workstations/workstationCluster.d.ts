/**
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Workstation Cluster Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("defaultNetwork", {autoCreateSubnetworks: false}, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const defaultSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("defaultSubnetwork", {
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.0.0/24",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.name,
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const defaultWorkstationCluster = new gcp.workstations.WorkstationCluster("defaultWorkstationCluster", {
 *     workstationClusterId: "workstation-cluster",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.id,
 *     subnetwork: defaultSubnetwork.id,
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     labels: {
 *         label: "key",
 *     },
 *     annotations: {
 *         "label-one": "value-one",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * ```
 * ### Workstation Cluster Private
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("defaultNetwork", {autoCreateSubnetworks: false}, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const defaultSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("defaultSubnetwork", {
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.0.0.0/24",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.name,
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const defaultWorkstationCluster = new gcp.workstations.WorkstationCluster("defaultWorkstationCluster", {
 *     workstationClusterId: "workstation-cluster-private",
 *     network: defaultNetwork.id,
 *     subnetwork: defaultSubnetwork.id,
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     privateClusterConfig: {
 *         enablePrivateEndpoint: true,
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         label: "key",
 *     },
 *     annotations: {
 *         "label-one": "value-one",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * ```
 *
