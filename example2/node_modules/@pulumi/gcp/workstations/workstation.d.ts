 * const defaultWorkstation = new gcp.workstations.Workstation("defaultWorkstation", {
 *     workstationId: "work-station",
 *     workstationConfigId: defaultWorkstationConfig.workstationConfigId,
 *     workstationClusterId: defaultWorkstationCluster.workstationClusterId,

 * ## Import
 *
 * Workstation can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstation:Workstation default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/workstationClusters/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/workstationConfigs/{{workstation_config_id}}/workstations/{{workstation_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstation:Workstation default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:workstations/workstation:Workstation default {{location}}/{{workstation_cluster_id}}/{{workstation_config_id}}/{{workstation_id}}
