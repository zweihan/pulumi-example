/**
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Keyset Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheKeyset("default", {
 *     description: "The default keyset",
 *     publicKeys: [
 *         {
 *             id: "my-public-key",
 *             value: "FHsTyFHNmvNpw4o7-rp-M1yqMyBF8vXSBRkZtkQ0RKY",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             id: "my-public-key-2",

 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Network Services Edge Cache Keyset Dual Token
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const secret_basic = new gcp.secretmanager.Secret("secret-basic", {
 *     secretId: "secret-name",
 *     replication: {
 *         automatic: true,
 *     },
 * });
 * const secret_version_basic = new gcp.secretmanager.SecretVersion("secret-version-basic", {
 *     secret: secret_basic.id,
 *     secretData: "secret-data",
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.networkservices.EdgeCacheKeyset("default", {
 *     description: "The default keyset",
 *     publicKeys: [{
 *         id: "my-public-key",
 *         managed: true,
 *     }],
 *     validationSharedKeys: [{
 *         secretVersion: secret_version_basic.id,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
