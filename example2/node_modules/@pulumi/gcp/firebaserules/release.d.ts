import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * For more information, see:
 * * [Get started with Firebase Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/get-started)
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Firestore_release
 * Creates a Firebase Rules Release to Cloud Firestore
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const firestore = new gcp.firebaserules.Ruleset("firestore", {
 *     source: {
 *         files: [{
 *             content: "service cloud.firestore {match /databases/{database}/documents { match /{document=**} { allow read, write: if false; } } }",
 *             name: "firestore.rules",
 *         }],
 *     },
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 * });
 * const primary = new gcp.firebaserules.Release("primary", {
 *     rulesetName: pulumi.interpolate`projects/my-project-name/rulesets/${firestore.name}`,
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Storage_release
 * Creates a Firebase Rules Release for a Storage bucket
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * // Provision a non-default Cloud Storage bucket.
 * const bucketBucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("bucketBucket", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-west1",
 * });
 * // Make the Storage bucket accessible for Firebase SDKs, authentication, and Firebase Security Rules.
 * const bucketStorageBucket = new gcp.firebase.StorageBucket("bucketStorageBucket", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     bucketId: bucketBucket.name,
 * });
 * // Create a ruleset of Firebase Security Rules from a local file.
 * const storage = new gcp.firebaserules.Ruleset("storage", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     source: {
 *         files: [{
 *             name: "storage.rules",
 *             content: "service firebase.storage {match /b/{bucket}/o {match /{allPaths=**} {allow read, write: if request.auth != null;}}}",
 *         }],
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [bucketStorageBucket],
 * });
 * const primary = new gcp.firebaserules.Release("primary", {
 *     rulesetName: pulumi.interpolate`projects/my-project-name/rulesets/${storage.name}`,
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Release can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:firebaserules/release:Release default projects/{{project}}/releases/{{name}}
 * ```
