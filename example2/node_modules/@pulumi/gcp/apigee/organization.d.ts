/**
 * An `Organization` is the top-level container in Apigee.
 *
 * To get more information about Organization, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Creating an API organization](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/create-org)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Apigee Organization Cloud Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const current = gcp.organizations.getClientConfig({});
 * const apigeeNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("apigeeNetwork", {});
 * const apigeeRange = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("apigeeRange", {
 *     purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     prefixLength: 16,
 *     network: apigeeNetwork.id,
 * });
 * const apigeeVpcConnection = new gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("apigeeVpcConnection", {
 *     network: apigeeNetwork.id,
 *     service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
 *     reservedPeeringRanges: [apigeeRange.name],
 * });
 * const org = new gcp.apigee.Organization("org", {
 *     analyticsRegion: "us-central1",
 *     projectId: current.then(current => current.project),
 *     authorizedNetwork: apigeeNetwork.id,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [apigeeVpcConnection],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Apigee Organization Cloud Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const current = gcp.organizations.getClientConfig({});
 * const apigeeNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("apigeeNetwork", {});
 * const apigeeRange = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("apigeeRange", {
 *     purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     prefixLength: 16,
 *     network: apigeeNetwork.id,
 * });
 * const apigeeVpcConnection = new gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("apigeeVpcConnection", {
 *     network: apigeeNetwork.id,
 *     service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
 *     reservedPeeringRanges: [apigeeRange.name],
 * });
 * const apigeeKeyring = new gcp.kms.KeyRing("apigeeKeyring", {location: "us-central1"});
 * const apigeeKey = new gcp.kms.CryptoKey("apigeeKey", {keyRing: apigeeKeyring.id});
 * const apigeeSa = new gcp.projects.ServiceIdentity("apigeeSa", {
 *     project: google_project.project.project_id,
 *     service: google_project_service.apigee.service,
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const apigeeSaKeyuser = new gcp.kms.CryptoKeyIAMBinding("apigeeSaKeyuser", {
 *     cryptoKeyId: apigeeKey.id,
 *     role: "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter",
 *     members: [pulumi.interpolate`serviceAccount:${apigeeSa.email}`],
 * });
 * const org = new gcp.apigee.Organization("org", {
 *     analyticsRegion: "us-central1",
 *     displayName: "apigee-org",
 *     description: "Auto-provisioned Apigee Org.",
 *     projectId: current.then(current => current.project),
 *     authorizedNetwork: apigeeNetwork.id,
 *     runtimeDatabaseEncryptionKeyName: apigeeKey.id,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [
 *         apigeeVpcConnection,
 *         apigeeSaKeyuser,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Organization can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:apigee/organization:Organization default organizations/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:apigee/organization:Organization default {{name}}
 * ```
