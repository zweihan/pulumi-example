 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Filestore Backup Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const instance = new gcp.filestore.Instance("instance", {
 *     location: "us-central1-b",
 *     tier: "BASIC_SSD",
 *     fileShares: {
 *         capacityGb: 2560,
 *         name: "share1",
 *     },
 *     networks: [{
 *         network: "default",
 *         modes: ["MODE_IPV4"],
 *         connectMode: "DIRECT_PEERING",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const backup = new gcp.filestore.Backup("backup", {
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     sourceInstance: instance.id,
 *     sourceFileShare: "share1",
 *     description: "This is a filestore backup for the test instance",
 *     labels: {
 *         files: "label1",
 *         "other-label": "label2",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Backup can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:filestore/backup:Backup default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/backups/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
