/**
 * Creates a Google Cloud Bigtable GC Policy inside a family. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/) and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/go/reference).
 *
 * > **Warning**: We don't recommend having multiple GC policies for the same column
 * family as it may result in unexpected behavior.
 *
 * > **Note**: GC policies associated with a replicated table cannot be destroyed directly.
 * Destroying a GC policy is translated into never perform garbage collection, this is
 * considered relaxing from pure age-based or version-based GC policy, hence not allowed.
 * The workaround is unreplicating the instance first by updating the instance to have one
 * cluster.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const instance = new gcp.bigtable.Instance("instance", {clusters: [{
 *     clusterId: "tf-instance-cluster",
 *     numNodes: 3,
 *     storageType: "HDD",
 * }]});
 * const table = new gcp.bigtable.Table("table", {
 *     instanceName: instance.name,
 *     columnFamilies: [{
 *         family: "name",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const policy = new gcp.bigtable.GCPolicy("policy", {
 *     instanceName: instance.name,
 *     table: table.name,
 *     columnFamily: "name",
 *     deletionPolicy: "ABANDON",
 *     gcRules: `  {
 *     "rules": [
 *       {
 *         "max_age": "168h"
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * `,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Multiple conditions is also supported. `UNION` when any of its sub-policies apply (OR). `INTERSECTION` when all its sub-policies apply (AND)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const policy = new gcp.bigtable.GCPolicy("policy", {
 *     instanceName: google_bigtable_instance.instance.name,
 *     table: google_bigtable_table.table.name,
 *     columnFamily: "name",
 *     deletionPolicy: "ABANDON",
 *     gcRules: `  {
 *     "mode": "union",
 *     "rules": [
 *       {
 *         "max_age": "168h"
 *       },
 *       {
 *         "max_version": 10
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * `,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * An example of more complex GC policy:
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const instance = new gcp.bigtable.Instance("instance", {
 *     clusters: [{
 *         clusterId: "cid",
 *         zone: "us-central1-b",
 *     }],
 *     instanceType: "DEVELOPMENT",
 *     deletionProtection: false,
 * });
 * const table = new gcp.bigtable.Table("table", {
 *     instanceName: instance.id,
 *     columnFamilies: [{
 *         family: "cf1",
 *     }],
 * });
 * const policy = new gcp.bigtable.GCPolicy("policy", {
 *     instanceName: instance.id,
 *     table: table.name,
 *     columnFamily: "cf1",
 *     deletionPolicy: "ABANDON",
 *     gcRules: `  {
 *     "mode": "union",
 *     "rules": [
 *       {
 *         "max_age": "10h"
 *       },
 *       {
 *         "mode": "intersection",
 *         "rules": [
 *           {
 *             "max_age": "2h"
 *           },
 *           {
 *             "max_version": 2
 *           }
 *         ]
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * `,
 * });
 * ```
 * This is equivalent to running the following `cbt` command:
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * This resource does not support import.
