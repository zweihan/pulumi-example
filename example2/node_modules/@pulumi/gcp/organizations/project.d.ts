/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const myProject = new gcp.organizations.Project("myProject", {
 *     orgId: "1234567",
 *     projectId: "your-project-id",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To create a project under a specific folder
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const department1 = new gcp.organizations.Folder("department1", {
 *     displayName: "Department 1",
 *     parent: "organizations/1234567",
 * });
 * const myProject_in_a_folder = new gcp.organizations.Project("myProject-in-a-folder", {
 *     projectId: "your-project-id",
 *     folderId: department1.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Projects can be imported using the `project_id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/project:Project my_project your-project-id
 * ```
