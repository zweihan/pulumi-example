/**
 * Models are deployed into it, and afterwards Endpoint is called to obtain predictions and explanations.
 *
 * To get more information about Endpoint, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.endpoints)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Vertex Ai Endpoint Network
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const vertexNetwork = gcp.compute.getNetwork({
 *     name: "network-name",
 * });
 * const vertexRange = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("vertexRange", {
 *     purpose: "VPC_PEERING",
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     prefixLength: 24,
 *     network: vertexNetwork.then(vertexNetwork => vertexNetwork.id),
 * });
 * const vertexVpcConnection = new gcp.servicenetworking.Connection("vertexVpcConnection", {
 *     network: vertexNetwork.then(vertexNetwork => vertexNetwork.id),
 *     service: "servicenetworking.googleapis.com",
 *     reservedPeeringRanges: [vertexRange.name],
 * });
 * const project = gcp.organizations.getProject({});
 * const endpoint = new gcp.vertex.AiEndpoint("endpoint", {
 *     displayName: "sample-endpoint",
 *     description: "A sample vertex endpoint",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     labels: {
 *         "label-one": "value-one",
 *     },
 *     network: Promise.all([project, vertexNetwork]).then(([project, vertexNetwork]) => `projects/${project.number}/global/networks/${vertexNetwork.name}`),
 *     encryptionSpec: {
 *         kmsKeyName: "kms-name",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [vertexVpcConnection],
 * });
 * const cryptoKey = new gcp.kms.CryptoKeyIAMMember("cryptoKey", {
 *     cryptoKeyId: "kms-name",
 *     role: "roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter",
 *     member: project.then(project => `serviceAccount:service-${project.number}@gcp-sa-aiplatform.iam.gserviceaccount.com`),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Endpoint can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiEndpoint:AiEndpoint default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/endpoints/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiEndpoint:AiEndpoint default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:vertex/aiEndpoint:AiEndpoint default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
