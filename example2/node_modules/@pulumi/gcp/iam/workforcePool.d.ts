/**
 * Represents a collection of external workforces. Provides namespaces for
 * federated users that can be referenced in IAM policies.
 *
 * To get more information about WorkforcePool, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/locations.workforcePools)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Manage pools](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workforce-identity-pools-providers#manage_pools)
 *

 *     location: "global",
 *     parent: "organizations/123456789",
 *     sessionDuration: "7200s",
 *     workforcePoolId: "example-pool",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * WorkforcePool can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:iam/workforcePool:WorkforcePool default locations/{{location}}/workforcePools/{{workforce_pool_id}}
