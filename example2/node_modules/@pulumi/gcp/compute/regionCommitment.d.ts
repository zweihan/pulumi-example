/**
 * Represents a regional Commitment resource.
 *
 * Creating a commitment resource means that you are purchasing a committed
 * use contract with an explicit start and end time. You can create commitments
 * based on vCPUs and memory usage and receive discounted rates.
 *
 * To get more information about RegionCommitment, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionCommitments)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Committed use discounts for Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/committed-use-discounts-overview)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Compute Region Commitment Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.RegionCommitment("foobar", {
 *     plan: "THIRTY_SIX_MONTH",
 *     resources: [
 *         {
 *             amount: "4",
 *             type: "VCPU",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             amount: "9",
 *             type: "MEMORY",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Compute Region Commitment Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const foobar = new gcp.compute.RegionCommitment("foobar", {
 *     autoRenew: true,
 *     category: "MACHINE",
 *     description: "some description",
 *     plan: "THIRTY_SIX_MONTH",
 *     resources: [
 *         {
 *             amount: "4",
 *             type: "VCPU",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             amount: "9",
 *             type: "MEMORY",
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     type: "MEMORY_OPTIMIZED",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RegionCommitment can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionCommitment:RegionCommitment default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/commitments/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionCommitment:RegionCommitment default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionCommitment:RegionCommitment default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/regionCommitment:RegionCommitment default {{name}}
 * ```
