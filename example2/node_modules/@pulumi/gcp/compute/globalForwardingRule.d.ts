/**
 * Represents a GlobalForwardingRule resource. Global forwarding rules are
 * used to forward traffic to the correct load balancer for HTTP load
 * balancing. Global forwarding rules can only be used for HTTP load
 * balancing.
 *
 * For more information, see
 * https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Global Forwarding Rule External Managed
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultBackendService = new gcp.compute.BackendService("defaultBackendService", {
 *     portName: "http",
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 *     timeoutSec: 10,
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "EXTERNAL_MANAGED",
 * });
 * const defaultURLMap = new gcp.compute.URLMap("defaultURLMap", {
 *     description: "a description",
 *     defaultService: defaultBackendService.id,
 *     hostRules: [{
 *         hosts: ["mysite.com"],
 *         pathMatcher: "allpaths",
 *     }],
 *     pathMatchers: [{
 *         name: "allpaths",
 *         defaultService: defaultBackendService.id,
 *         pathRules: [{
 *             paths: ["/*"],
 *             service: defaultBackendService.id,
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const defaultTargetHttpProxy = new gcp.compute.TargetHttpProxy("defaultTargetHttpProxy", {
 *     description: "a description",
 *     urlMap: defaultURLMap.id,
 * });
 * const defaultGlobalForwardingRule = new gcp.compute.GlobalForwardingRule("defaultGlobalForwardingRule", {
 *     target: defaultTargetHttpProxy.id,
 *     portRange: "80",
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "EXTERNAL_MANAGED",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Private Service Connect Google Apis
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network = new gcp.compute.Network("network", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const vpcSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("vpcSubnetwork", {
 *     project: network.project,
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.2.0.0/16",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: network.id,
 *     privateIpGoogleAccess: true,
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const defaultGlobalAddress = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("defaultGlobalAddress", {
 *     project: network.project,
 *     addressType: "INTERNAL",
 *     purpose: "PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT",
 *     network: network.id,
 *     address: "100.100.100.106",
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const defaultGlobalForwardingRule = new gcp.compute.GlobalForwardingRule("defaultGlobalForwardingRule", {
 *     project: network.project,
 *     target: "all-apis",
 *     network: network.id,
 *     ipAddress: defaultGlobalAddress.id,
 *     loadBalancingScheme: "",
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GlobalForwardingRule can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalForwardingRule:GlobalForwardingRule default projects/{{project}}/global/forwardingRules/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
