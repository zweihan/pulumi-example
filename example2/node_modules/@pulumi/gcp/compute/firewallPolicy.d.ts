/**
 * Hierarchical firewall policy rules let you create and enforce a consistent firewall policy across your organization. Rules can explicitly allow or deny connections or delegate evaluation to lower level policies. Policies can be created within organizations or folders.
 *
 * This resource should be generally be used with `gcp.compute.FirewallPolicyAssociation` and `gcp.compute.FirewallPolicyRule`
 *
 * For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewall-policies)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const _default = new gcp.compute.FirewallPolicy("default", {
 *     description: "Example Resource",
 *     parent: "organizations/12345",
 *     shortName: "my-policy",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * FirewallPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicy:FirewallPolicy default locations/global/firewallPolicies/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/firewallPolicy:FirewallPolicy default {{name}}
 * ```
