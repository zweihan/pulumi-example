/**
 * An SslCertificate resource, used for HTTPS load balancing.  This resource
 * represents a certificate for which the certificate secrets are created and
 * managed by Google.
 *
 * For a resource where you provide the key, see the
 * SSL Certificate resource.
 *
 * To get more information about ManagedSslCertificate, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/sslCertificates)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates)
 *
 * > **Warning:** This resource should be used with extreme caution!  Provisioning an SSL
 * certificate is complex.  Ensure that you understand the lifecycle of a
 * certificate before attempting complex tasks like cert rotation automatically.
 * This resource will "return" as soon as the certificate object is created,
 * but post-creation the certificate object will go through a "provisioning"
 * process.  The provisioning process can complete only when the domain name
 * for which the certificate is created points to a target pool which, itself,
 * points at the certificate.  Depending on your DNS provider, this may take
 * some time, and migrating from self-managed certificates to Google-managed
 * certificates may entail some downtime while the certificate provisions.
 *
 * In conclusion: Be extremely cautious.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ManagedSslCertificate can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/managedSslCertificate:ManagedSslCertificate default projects/{{project}}/global/sslCertificates/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/managedSslCertificate:ManagedSslCertificate default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/managedSslCertificate:ManagedSslCertificate default {{name}}
 * ```
