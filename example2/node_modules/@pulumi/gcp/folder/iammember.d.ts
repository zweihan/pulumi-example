/**
 * Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a folder. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.folder.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the folder and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.folder.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the folder are preserved.
 * * `gcp.folder.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the folder are preserved.
 * * `gcp.folder.IamAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.folder.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.folder.IAMBinding`, `gcp.folder.IAMMember`, or `gcp.folder.IamAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.folder.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.folder.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * > **Note:** The underlying API method `projects.setIamPolicy` has constraints which are documented [here](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy). In addition to these constraints,
 *    IAM Conditions cannot be used with Basic Roles such as Owner. Violating these constraints will result in the API returning a 400 error code so please review these if you encounter errors with this resource.

 *
 * !> **Be careful!** You can accidentally lock yourself out of your folder
 *    using this resource. Deleting a `gcp.folder.IAMPolicy` removes access
 *    from anyone without permissions on its parent folder/organization. Proceed with caution.
 *    It's not recommended to use `gcp.folder.IAMPolicy` with your provider folder
 *    to avoid locking yourself out, and it should generally only be used with folders
 *    fully managed by this provider. If you do use this resource, it is recommended to **import** the policy before
 *    applying the change.

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account.
 *
 * This member resource can be imported using the `folder`, role, and member e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:folder/iAMMember:IAMMember my_folder "folder roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question and the role.
 *
 * This binding resource can be imported using the `folder` and role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:folder/iAMMember:IAMMember my_folder "folder roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question.
 *
 * This policy resource can be imported using the `folder`.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:folder/iAMMember:IAMMember my_folder folder
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM audit config imports use the identifier of the resource in question and the service, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:folder/iAMMember:IAMMember my_folder "folder foo.googleapis.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  -> **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 * full name of the custom role, e.g. `organizations/{{org_id}}/roles/{{role_id}}`. -> **Conditional IAM Bindings**If you're importing a IAM binding with a condition block, make sure
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:folder/iAMMember:IAMMember to include the title of condition, e.g. `google_folder_iam_binding.my_folder "folder roles/{{role_id}} condition-title"`
 * ```
